RNGs in the mediocre directory are not intended for real world use
only for research; as such they may get pretty sloppy in some areas

This set is of RNGs that use at least one of the following:
1. complex flow control
2. complex math functions (sqrt, log/exp, sin/cos, etc)
3. anything else not covered by simple.h, mult.h, indirection.h, or fibonacci.h
