4. Tests that were not included

This file documents the results of the various test suites on various RNGs.  
The test suites used include PractRand, TestU01, a not-yet-releasd version 
of RaBiGeTe, and Dieharder.  The RNGs include over over 100 RNGs I selected 
from a wide variety of categories.  Some were RNGs actually in use, some 
were obscure RNGs, some were RNGs I made up just to have a wider variety.

Times are very rough figures based upon modern desktop x86 CPUs, but using only one core (no multithreading).  
(times were fairly similar on a variety of such CPUs)

RNG biases found only by one test battery when each battery is given up to 4 
hours per RNG to search for bias.  (RaBiGeTe and Dieharder did not have any 
productive tests lasting that long, so they used smaller amounts of time)

All results are based upon a set of a little over 100 RNGs, listed below.  
Some categories of RNGs were omitted - candidate RNGs were not counted, 
nor were "Transforms applied to various low quality RNGs".

PractRand std:
	The standard test battery of PractRand.  
	The only test suite to allow functionally unlimited test lengths.  
	The only test suite to offer interim results.  
	caveats:
		Cheats slightly on all RNGs by looking at the metadata - it treats 8 bit RNGs slightly differently than 32 bit RNGs, etc
		Requires more bits to find bias than any other test suite (of those listed).  
		May be cheating slightly on the LCGs - it often runs out the periods on those instead of finding bias the normal way.  
		Multithreading is supported, but max speedup tends to be limited to about 3x.  
	vs time:
		10 seconds: PractRand standard 512 MB
		1 minute:   PractRand standard 4 GB
		5 minutes:  PractRand standard 16 GB
		30 minutes: PractRand standard 128 GB
		4 hours:    PractRand standard 1 TB
		16 hours:   PractRand standard 4 TB

TestU01 *Crush:
	Meaning SmallCrush, Crush, and BigCrush from TestU01.  
	The only test suite with a big name academic in the field behind it.  
	The only test to guarantee (on default settings anyway) that all subtest results are 100% independant.  
	caveats:
		Does not support multithreading.  
		More sensitive to RNG speed than the other test suites (of those listed) at default settings.  
	vs time:
		10 seconds: SmallCrush
		1 minute:   --
		5 minutes:  --
		30 minutes: Crush
		4 hours:    BigCrush
		16 hours:   --

RaBiGeTe ext:
	The "extended" preset of RaBiGeTe, but with DFT disabled.  
	(DFT wasn't adding anything to the results and was preventing longer tests from working)
	Can find bias in many RNGs using fewer bits than the other test suites.  
	Supports multithreading better than the other test suites (of those listed).  
	caveats:
		Tended to crash a bit.  
		I was using a pre-release version - the released versions at the time had some issues.  
		I had to ignore the authors instructions and make up my own to get clear & correct results.  
		The recent versions seem to be GUI-only, making it harder to automate.  
		The "30 minute" results actually took about 40 minutes... I was kinda generous there.  
	vs time:
		10 seconds: RaBiGeTe extended 2 Mb
		1 minute:   RaBiGeTe extended 16 Mb
		5 minutes:  RaBiGeTe extended 64 Mb
		30 minutes: RaBiGeTe extended 512 Mb (actually took about 40 minutes)
		4 hours:    --
		16 hours:   --

Dieharder (-a):
	Dieharder used with the -a command line option.  
		(the only predefined set of tests in Dieharder, so far as I can tell)
	Very few biases found
	only a few tests showed significant ability to detect bias:
		dab_monobit2 (the best test in Dieharder by far)
		dab_dct (the next best test, I think)
		dab_filltree
		dab_filltree2
		diehard_opso
		diehard_oqso
		dab_bytedistrib
	and many tests had problems:
		Test name             Problems
		marsaglia_tsang_gcd   FALSE POSITIVES, very slow
		sts_serial            FALSE POSITIVES
		rgb_lagged_sum        FALSE POSITIVES
		diehard_dna           very slow
		diehard_sums          broken for metatests
		diehard_runs          broken for metatests
		rgb_bitdist           very slow
		rgb_minimum_distance  very slow
		rgb_kstest            broken for metatests
		("very slow" refers to as parameterized in the "-a" set of tests)
	takes about 40 minutes on my computer on a fast RNG

Dieharder (custom):
	Used some shell scripts to run Dieharder with a custom arrangement of tests
	Used several sets of tests & parameters for various time increments:
		tests:     monobit2    dct       filltree2 filltree bytedistrib
		10 second: 100000000   100000    --        --       --
		1 minute:  500000000   500000    5000000   15000000 51200000
		5 minutes: 2000000000  3000000   48000000  48000000 512000000
	(all of those test names have the prefix "dab_" omitted)
	Unfortunately, Dieharder does not permit test lengths longer than about 
	2 billion, so dab_monobit2 cannot increase beyond what's used in the 5 
	minute version there.  Increasing the rest of the tests lengths produces 
	very little return on the investment, so there's not much point to a run 
	longer than 5 minutes.  
	As an example, the command lines I use for the 10 second test on the RNG 
	named ranrot32 is:
		./RNG_output ranrot32 name
		./RNG_output ranrot32 123456789000000 | dieharder -g 200 -D 504 -D 16384 -d dab_monobit2 -t 100000000
		./RNG_output ranrot32 123456789000000 | dieharder -g 200 -D 504 -D 16384 -d dab_dct -t 100000

NIST STS (Statistical Test Suite)
	I've made a few modifications to improve performance and allow it to 
	work on large samples than it could normally.  
	It's producing false positives for me on the non-overlapping template 
	test, when using larger sample sizes and larger numbers of samples.  At 
	128 samples the largest sample size I can safely use on that test is 8 
	megabits.  
	It seems to strongly encourage the use of large numbers of small 
	samples - its summary report will actually avoid listing individual 
	test p-values even if only one sample was run, instead showing only 
	number of test p-values within the normal range and a meta-test p-value.  
	Possibly it doesn't trust its basic p-value quality enough to show them, 
	or possibly it's just a brain-damaged interface.  
	It is extremely inefficient.  It likes to unpack binary data to 1 bit 
	per byte, among other inefficiencies.  It is also extremely weak, with 
	the very poor efficiency, poor sensivity, and poor or very poor breadth.

	notes on the meaning of *lcg names:
		lcg(X,Y) means an LCG with modulus 2^Y, discarding (Y-X) low bits to produce X bit output
		clcg(X,Y) means lcg(X,Y-32) combined with a 32 bit non-power-of-2-modulus LCG
		xlcg(X,Y) is similar to lcg(X,Y), but xor is used in place of addition
			(i.e. equivalent to suppresing the carries on the addition in binary)
		cxlcg(X,Y) means xlcg(X,Y-32) combined with a 32 bit non-power-of-2-modulus LCG

*****************************************************************************
3. Details of the results format
*****************************************************************************

columns:
	RNG
		The name of the RNG algorithm used;
		The name used is the name it is called in PractRand, not necessarily 
		its real full name - for instance, hc256 instead of HC-256.  
	PractRand standard
		The PractRand standard tests are those returned by 
		PractRand::Tests::Batteries::get_standard_tests().  
		quirks:
			test set is (slightly) dependent upon RNG metadata
		speed on a fast RNG on my computer (in single-threaded mode):
			1 GB: ~15 seconds
			1 TB: ~4 hours
		format:
			The length of sequence required for the PractRand standard tests 
			to detect bias.  If multiple seeds were tested, and bias was 
			found in them at different sequence lengths, then the median 
			result is used.  If bias was not found then the length of the 
			longest sequence tested is recorded, with a ">" prefixed in 
			front of it.  
			Bias is considered to have been found when the standard tool 
			rates the result as "FAIL" (with or without exclamation marks).  
			(p-value threshold vary with circumstances but are typically 
			near 1e-10 on the low side and 1 - 1e-10 on the high side)
			The length is recorded as a number followed by KB, MB, GB, or 
			TB.  Those stand for kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte, or terabyte 
			respectively.  
			All lengths are rounded up to the nearest power of 2.  
	TestU01 *Crush
		This refers to the batteries "SmallCrush", "Crush", and "BigCrush" 
		in TestU01.
		quirks:
			does not accept a sequence length parameter
			works on RNGs outputing 31 bits per call:
				on 32 bit RNGs it works but disregards the lowest bit?!?
				on 8/16 bit RNGs, I concatonate multiple outputs together to produce a 32 bit output
				on 64 bit RNGs... I am currently discarding the upper 32 bits to produce a 32 bit output
					might, in the future, change that to returning half and buffering half for the next call
			does not print any results until all are ready
		speed on a fast RNG on my computer:
			SmallCrush: ~8 seconds
			Crush:      ~30 minutes
			BigCrush:   ~4 hours
		format:
			If all 3 are passed then the result is recorded as "pass".  
			Otherwise, the result is recorded as X/Y/Z, where X is the 
			number of tests failed in SmallCrush, Y is the number failed in 
			Crush, and Z is the number failed in BigCrush.  
			Failure is defined as a p-value <= 1.0e-10 or >= (1 - 1.0e-10)
	RaBiGeTe extended
		This refers to the preset testing parameters named "extended", but see the quirks section.  
		quirks:
			In order to get 512 Mb samples to run on extended I had to disable the DFT test
			I used a more recent version of RaBiGeTe that has not been publicly released at this time.  
			I used RaBiGeTe in a slightly non-standard way, testing single long samples instead of many short samples.  
				In my testing this method worked much better than the recommended way.  
			It crashed several times during testing.  
		speed on a fast RNG on my computer:
			16 Mb: just over 1 minute
			512 Mb: a little under 40 minutes
		format:
			The same format was used as for PractRand standard, with three exceptions.  
			A result was considered a failure if any p-value was <= 1e-10, or if 5 or 
			more p-values were <= 0.000001 or >= 0.999999, or if any p-values were 
			omitted from the results.  I never consider a single p-value close to one  
			a failure in RaBiGeTe even if it is exactly 1.0.  
			The second exception is that lengths are listed in bits instead of bytes.  
			The third exception is that if an RNG passed 512 megabits of testing then it was listed as "pass".  
				... because RaBiGeTe was unable to test sequences longer than 512 Mb on the settings I used.  

	If a result is listed as "?" that means that that test has not been run 
	on that RNG.  If a result has a normal value followed by a "?" that 
	means that either that result is strongly implied by tests on nearly 
	equivalent RNGs, or that the test was run and is believed to have 
	produced that result but the record-keeping involved was incomplete and 
	I can't be sure without re-running the test.

4. Tests that were not included
*****************************************************************************

tests that were not included:
	PractRand expanded standard
		This test battery was not used because:
			A. It significantly underperforms PractRand standard on fast RNGs.  
			B. If I listed its test results here I'd have to update them 
				every time I added a new test to it.  
	TestU01 Rabbit
		This test battery was not used because:
			A. It consistently crashes if used on a long sequence
			B. Its time to complete a test does not increase linearly with 
				sequence length - in some cases it actually decreases with 
				length.  This appears to be partially caused by the test 
				set being a function of the testing length.  
			C. Its results do not seem to improve in power with sequence 
				length consistently enough.  
	TestU01 Pseudo-diehard
		This test battery was not used because its quality is too low.  
	NIST RNG tests
		This test battery was not used because:
			A. Severe difficulty with longer test runs due to not only 
				keeping the whole sequence in memory, but also 
				inflating the sequence to store only one bit per byte.  
			B. Poor quality relative to speed, poor maximum quality 
				given the short maximum sample lengths.
