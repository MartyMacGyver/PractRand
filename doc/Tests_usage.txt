***********************************************************************

There are several different interfaces which can be used to access 
PractRands statistical tests for pseudo-random number generators.  
Internally each higher level interfaces is implemented using the next 
lowest level interface.  

The high level interface (and thus the simplest for a normal user) is 
the tool RNG_test, which can be controlled from the command line.  See 
section 1 of Tests_overview.txt and also the relevant section of 
tools.txt for information on how to use that.  

***********************************************************************

The intermediate interface is that of test batteries and managers.  
You can obtain a battery of tests by calling the PractRand libraries 
test battery functions, which are in the namespace 
PractRand::Tests::Batteries (see include/PractRand/test_batteries.h).  
The test manager class is not technically part of the PractRand 
library at this time, but you can find its code in tools/TestManager.h
- the interface is at the top, the implementation below.  Note that 
this is not self-contained (it requires several headers be included 
before it) nor isolated (if you want it in a namespace you will have 
to wrap the include statement to put it there).  A subclass that 
extends that to let the RNG and each test run in its own thread is 
also available in tools/MultithreadedTestManager.h

The interface to the TestManager class is documented in TestManager.h, 
but if you want an example of a program using this interface, see 
tools/RNG_test.cpp.  If you're feeling lazy, you can just modify 
RNG_test.cpp to include your RNG and then recompile it.  The RNG named 
DummyRNG near the top of RNG_test.cpp was intended for that purpose.  

***********************************************************************

The low level interface works directly with Tests and arrays of 
kilobyte-sized blocks of random bits.  The raw testing interface (ie 
the baseclass from which all PractRand tests for raw datastreams are 
derived) is in: include/PractRand/tests.h

You can also see the tests in action in the sample program in 
tools/RNG_test.cpp
Note that most of the important stuff is done in tools/TestManager.h

You can see how the standard test sets are instantiated in 
src/test_batteries.cpp

The process of testing a stream of data generally goes like this:

1. Call the tests constructor, with the tests parameters.  The parameters 
can not be changed after this (unless a new test is constructed).  

2. Call the tests init() method, which takes a known good polymorphic RNG 
as a parameter.  Most tests don't actually use the the known good RNG but 
some rare tests do and all tests in PractRand share the same API, so all 
tests must be handed a known good RNG.  

3. Create a block of memory to put the data to be tested in.  The data 
doesn't all have to fit at once.  The block of memory should come in the 
form of an array of the type PractRand::Tests::TestBlock.  Each TestBlock 
is 1 kilobyte in size, and should be filled with random bits.  TestBlock 
has a method for efficiently using a polymorphic RNG to fill it.  If you 
wish to fill it with a different data source then you'll have to do that 
manually.  

4. Pass the block of memory to the test, using the tests test_blocks() 
method.  The parameters are a pointer at the array of TestBlocks and the 
number of TestBlocks in that array.  Generally no more than half a 
gigabyte should be passed to test_blocks() in any single call, as some 
tests malfunction when handed 1 GB or more in a single call.  

[optional:] 5. Create more arrays of TestBlocks full of random bits 
and pass them to the test with test_blocks().  However, now you are 
supposed to have the tail end of the previous array of blocks prefixed on 
to the begining of each new array.  The pointer at the array of blocks 
should point to the part of the new array where the new stuff begins.  The 
maximum number of blocks that you may be required to prefix in this way is 
determined by calling the get_blocks_to_repeat() method of the test.  
I know this direction may be confusing.  Try looking at tools/TestManager.h
That class encapsulates complying with those demands.  
Like the known good RNG parameter, only a few tests actually need the 
repeated blocks, but all test users are supposed to comply with that part of 
the interface so that all tests get a common interface.  

6. Call the tests get_result() method with an empty vector.  It will 
fill the vector with TestResult objects, one per subtest of that test 
that produced a usable result.  The simple way to interpret a 
TestResult object is to refer to its name field or its get_pvalue 
method.  They support a lot more though including metadata about 
pvalue quality and importance, and functionality that allows it to 
report p-values in transformed coordinates that allow higher 
resolution on values very near one or zero.  

[optional:] 7. You can repeat the above procedure starting with step 5.  
It will remember the data it had recieved before just as if you had not 
called get_result().  This means you can get interim results part-way 
through a longer test without spoiling the longer test.  

8. Call the deinit() method of the test.  This resets the test state.  
In some (but not all) cases this will free up most of the memory used 
by the test.  The test parameters are not reset - they remain the same 
until the test is destructed.  

[optional:] 9. Repeat from step 2 above.  

10. Destruct the test object.  At this point all memory used by the 
test should be released.
