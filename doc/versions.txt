version 0.94
	RNGs
		xsm64
			revised
			old version was falling well short of intended quality on some seeds
		xsm32
			revised
		efiix8x384 / efiix16x384 / efiix32x384 / efiix64x384
			the large array sizes didn't realy help anything, so I shrunk them down to reduce memory & cache footprints
			where the old iteration table size used to be 128, it's now 32
			and where the old indirection table size used to be 256, it's now 16
			so the names are now efiix8x48 instead of efiix8x384, efiix16x48 instead of efiix16x384, etc
	tools
		RNG_test
			adjusted formating of raw outputs to better preserve columns during extreme failures
			changed listed seed for "RNGs" that don't have meaningful seed
			fixed off-by-1 bug causing evaluation thresholds to be slightly incorrect
			added new evalution threshold "normalish" between "normal" and "unusual"
			SeedingTester and EntropyPoolingTester meta-rngs that were only supported by command line options -ttseed64 and -ttep can now be specified as part of the RNG name
		RNG_output
			increased buffer size (again)
			fixed endianness issue (again?)
			now supports SeedingTester and EntropyPoolingTester meta-rngs
			adjust to how very large Raw values are printed, to preserve column alignment
	Test Batteries:
		core tests:
			added a new test, mod3n
				it doesn't help on all that many PRNGs, but the ones it does help with it helps a lot
				and it doesn't take much resources (largely because it's set up to only test a small fraction of the data stream)
				this one is inspired the mod3 test in jgrand
			added a new test, TMFn
				it doesn't help on all that many PRNGs, but the ones it does help with it helps a lot
				and it doesn't take much resources (largely because it's set up to only test a small fraction of the data stream)
				this one primarily targets LCGs
			FPF
				removed "all2" subtest
		expanded tests:
			added a new test, mod3n
			added a new test, TMFn
			added a new test, BirthdaySystematic
			various other changes?
	tests
		DistC6
			fixed bug that effected the parameterizations used in the expanded test set
				bug caused crashes on some platforms, had little to no effect on others
		BRank
			fixed semi-minor bug (again?)
		transforms
			FirstNofM
				bugfixes; however, I don't think this was actually used anywhere in PractRand before, so probably nothing visible
		mod3n
			based upon the mod3 test in gjrand (by Geronimo Jones)
			but it targets 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, etc bit blocks, all simultaneously, the same way BCFN does
			it does not find bias in a very wide variety of PRNGs, but several of the ones catches are otherwise very difficult to find bias in (flea32x1, ara32, ibaa32)
		TMFn
			intended to catch LCGs.  I may replace it with a different test intended for the same purpose in a later version.
	rng sets for testing
		adding to ease testing automation
version 0.93
	RNGs
		ALL RECOMMENDED RNGs!
			added customized seeding-from-another-RNG code to every recommended RNG
			on PRNGs with a statespace <= 2**128, it generally allows seeding to all states
			on PRNGs with statespaces >= 2**256, it generally restricts seeding to a possible number of initial states around the square root of the statespace
			on PRNGs with intermediate sizes, it goes somewhere in between
			this is to allow probabilistic proofs of zero bad cycles for PRNGs where that is practical
			also, the old generic seeding-from-an-RNG was not really desirable on recommended PRNGs, it was more of a quick-and-dirty solution
		sfc16 / sfc32 / sfc64
			improved shift constants (this changes the output sequences)
			adjusted seeding
		arbee
			tweaked feed-in algorithms slightly yet again
		efiix*
			adjust seeding, yet again
		non-recommended
			added xoroshiro128plus
			efiix variants were using the wrong algorithm
	tools
		RNG_test
			changed thresholds slightly
			multithreading fixes, particularly for unix platforms
			bug fix for --ttep mode
			increased buffer size for reading from stdin
		RNG_output
			increased buffer size
			added the ability to use "inf" in place of the number of bytes requested
			tweaked error messages, warning messages, usage messages, & documentation
	Tests:
		BRank
			minor bug-fixes and adjustments to how extreme results are reported
			32 bit executables now have smaller maximum matrix size than 64 bit executables, to minimize crashes related to exhausting address space
		BCFN_FF
			more conservative p-values for the ":freq" subtests (the p-values are still awful, but are now less likely to produce "suspicious" results on good PRNGs)
		FPF
			fix for the ":all" result on short test runs
version 0.92
	RNGs
		non-recommended
			added two weakened variations of Trivium for testing purposes
	tools
		RNG_test now handles buffering when reading from stdin
			improvement speed, particularly for multithreading runs, when using external PRNGs
		RNG_test now uses C++11 functions to measure system time instead of CPU time
			can be disabled by commenting out #define CPP_2011_SUPPORTED near the top of RNG_test.cpp
				in case you don't have proper C++11 support
	Tests:
		new tests:
			Pat5 - not very good, short-ish range linear test
		BRank
			fixed the part where it was slightly violating the abstraction layer
		BCFN, BCFN_FF, BCFN_MT
			improved accuracy of some calculations, which may help particularly long test runs
	documentation
		added summary of NIST STS results to Test_results.txt
version 0.91
	RNGs
		efiix
			revised seeding algorithm slightly
		xsm32 & xsm64
			changed algorithm
			improved quality - mainly with respect to parallel generation
			worsened speed as a result though
			also improved seeding
		non-recommended
			fixed bugs in dual_cbuf, dual_cbuf_accum, isaac32_small
			added isaac16_small, efiix4_small
	Test Batteries:
		core:
			added an FPF parameterization
			added BRank (it's a new test, see below)
		expanded:
			various changes?
			(I don't usually remember to note when the expanded test set changes)
	Tests:
		new tests:
			BRank - fairly standard binary matrix rank test
			BCFN_MT - not working yet
			BCFN_FF - not worth the extra time it takes?
			FPMulti - not working yet
		FPF
			substantial optimizations
			improvements to scoring & subtest breakdown
			cleaned up some idiosyncracies
		BCFN
			significant optimizations
				test changed slightly (necessary for optimizations)
				might be slightly better or worse, can't tell yet
				optimizations are currently optional in the code
				though there's no way to turn them off from the command line tools
			also changed handling of first call to test_blocks, elminated the "!" subtest
		Gap-16
			improved calibration data (more accurate & less conservative p-values at extremes)
		DC6
			improved speed
	tools
		RNG_test now defaults to -tlfail (stop when a test is failed)
		fixed negative time issue in RNG_test
	documentation
		tried to improve a lot of docs
version 0.90
	other
		accidentally had some debugging code enabled in 0.89 and 0.88 that was breaking autoseeding, fixed
		had some header file case sensitivity issues
			fixed them, revised testing methodology to fix the issue that prevented me from noticing them
		added reinterpret-as RNG transforms
			to act as if the RNGs data was being piped around and reinterpretted at a different size
	RNGs
		efiix
			revised seeding algorithm slightly
		various RNGs
			added additional seeding options
	tools
		fixed a few bugs in RNG_output (and in the non-recommended RNGs)
version 0.89
	RNGs:
		chacha:
			disabled SIMD path, as alignment was not correct on dynamic allocations (isn't that counter to the spec?)
		salsa:
			added Salsa20, a predecessor to ChaCha
	tools:
		RNG_test:
			added -tlfail / -tlmaxonly command line options
				-tlfail causes it to stop testing once a failure is found
				-tlmaxonly causes it to continue testing after failures are found (the default, at the moment)
	other:
		fixed a portability issue with header files that got introduced at the last moment in 0.88
		some documentation changes (still needs more work)
version 0.88
	Important Bugfix:
		a serious bug introduced at the last minute in 0.87 in sha2_based_pool
		which gets used internally by autoseeding, among other things
version 0.87
	! The big changes were improved p-value quality, changed RNG test reporting format, more useful tools, and improved autoseeding.  
	RNG algorithms:
		chacha
			added new RNG: chacha
			this is a single 32 bit RNG with a variable quality setting, despite the naming convention
			cryptographic security, random access, and fast seeding
		jsf16 / jsf32 / jsf64
			very very minor tweak to jsf32 initialization
			removed jsf16 - with improvements in sfc16 it was no longer competitive
			added fast-seeding option
		sfc16 / sfc32 / sfc64
			fixed bug in seeding-from-an-RNG (sfc16 only)
			revised algorithm - now version 4 of sfc, old version moved in with the non-recommended RNGs
				revised version is slightly larger, slightly higher quality
			added fast-seeding option
		xsm32 / xsm64
			fixed bug in seeding-from-an-integer (xsm64 only)
			fixed bug in random access (xsm64 only)
			revised my rating downward by half a star
				(from 3.0 to 2.5 stars on xsm32, from 4.0 to 3.5 on xsm64)
				all indications are that it's very very good, but I just don't completely trust it yet
		mt19937
			added support for seeding from arbitrary length sequences of 32 bit integers
				(a standard mt19937 seeding method added in 2002 that I hadn't noticed)
			changed integer seeding algorithm for seeds >= 2**32
		arbee
			tweaked seeding
			changed & optimized add_entropy_N
			fixed metadata issue
			adjusted interfaces slightly
		other / non-recommended RNGs
			fixed a couple bugs
			added a couple algorithms
	Test interfaces:
		significant changes to how test results are reported
		fixed a few issues, some of which could produce false positives in rare circumstances
	Tests:
		BCFN
			dramatically improved quality of p-values
			now reports multiple p-values instead of combining them in to a single p-value
		Gap16
			dramatically improved quality of p-values
			now reports two p-values instead of combining them in to a single p-value
		DC6
			dramatically improved quality of p-values
		FPF
			dramatically improved quality of p-values
		CoupGap
			dramatically improved quality of p-values
	adjusted error handling
		user-defined callback called if present, otherwise it prints to stderr and does an exit(1)
	fixed several minor issues in initialization
		you can now tell whether PractRand found enough entropy by the return value of initialize_PractRand()
	improved PractRands self-test funcationality
		now verifies that mt19937, chacha, hc256, trivium, and isaac32x256 match test vectors
		and verifies that xsm32, xsm64, and chacha appear to fast-forward and rewind correctly
	revised autoseeding substantially
		fixed issues that could occur when threads were created immediately after threads were destroyed
		now uses the following scheme:
			if TLS is supported and the platform is recognized
				TLS + atomic increments manage thread-safe auto-seeding
			if TLS is supported but the platform is NOT recognized
				TLS + a leaked std::malloc(1) per thread manage thread-safe auto-seeding
			if TLS is NOT supported
				a slow method involving calls to std::clock() is used to manage thread-safe auto-seeding
	revised documentation slightly
		added documentation for parallel random number generation
			seperate from the pre-existing documentation on multithreaded random number generation
		revised thresholds for quality & speed in RNG engine ratings
		other minor documentation changes
	test programs
		renamed to tools
	tools
		RNG_test
			major revisions to interface - now command line driven, use --help for info
			added support for alternate mode for checking seeding quality
			added support for alternate mode for checking entropy pooling quality
			changed MSVC project name
		multithreaded RNG test
			unified code with RNG_test, there is no longer a separate project for MT testing
		RNG_output
			fixed a bug that caused some RNGs to be used unseeded
			revised naming scheme for nested RNGs: "[SShrink]jsf32"->"SShrink(jsf32)" or "[BDS256]jsf32"->"BDS(jsf32,8)"
				well, partially, still needs work
		Test_calibration
			new test program, added to document some of the calibration process
			I do NOT recommend the use of this for end users at this time.  

version 0.86
	RNGs algorithms:
		changes to specific RNGs:
			jsf16
				it was using the wrong shifts for some reason, fixed
				(that should improve quality)
			efiix8x384, efiix16x384, efiix32x384, efiix64x384
				tweaked seeding algorithm to improve speed
			trivium
				fixed bugs
				improved validation
	test programs:
		new test programs:
			Multithreaded RNG test
				like the old RNG_test, but uses multiple threads.  
				currently it likes to use about 5 threads total on the standard test set
				(1 for the RNG, 1 for each core test, 1 for all the extra foldings)
				but it doesn't keep those occupied all the time
				it has a bad habit of recreating its threads frequently instead of keeping a pool of workers

version 0.85
	! The big changes were in RNG interfaces, portability, and random access RNG algorithms.  
	fixed various issues preventing compilation on recent versions of gcc
		tested on gcc 4.6.1
	improved portability
		no config.h changes needed now when switching between the most common compilers
	RNG interfaces:
		light-weight RNGs:
			namespace changed: PractRand::RNGs -> PractRand::RNGs::LightWeight
			now available for all RNGs
			now defaults to using templates to implement light-weight RNGs
			can be disabled by defining PRACTRAND_NO_LIGHT_WEIGHT_RNGS
				(definition must occur prior to the #include of PractRand headers)
		polymorphic RNGs:
			fixed lack of virtual destructor (oops!)
		entropy pooling RNGs:
			namespace changed: PractRand::RNGs::Polymorphic::EntropyPools -> PractRand::RNGs::Polymorphic
			namespace changed: PractRand::RNGs::Raw::EntropyPools -> PractRand::RNGs::Raw
		serialization:
			Polymorphic RNGs now have serialization & deserialization methods
			other RNGs can be serialized as well, but no convenient interface atm
		random access aka seeking:
			now allows 128 bit seek distances (passed as two 64 bit numbers)
		Boost / C++0x TR1 compatibility:
			now ONLY available if PRACTRAND_BOOST_COMPATIBILITY is defined
				(must be defined before PractRand headers are included)
			now available on base class vRNG in addition to vRNG8/vRNG16/vRNG32/vRNG64
	RNGs algorithms:
		new algorithms:
			trivium
				*NOT ENABLED YET* (it's failing validation atm)
				all previous crypto RNG in PractRand were large-state indirection-based RNGs
				so I added a small-state non-indirection-based crypto RNG
				unfortunately it is somewhat slow
			xsm64
				the old random access algorithms (lcg64_32 and clcg96_32) sucked
				xsm64 is intended to replace clcg96_32
				like clcg96_32 it uses 64 bit math internally
				but unlike clcg96_32 it outputs a full 64 bits, not 32 bits
				and unlike clcg96_32 it is acceptable for parallel uses
			xsm32
				the old random access algorithms (lcg64_32 and lcg96_32) sucked
				xsm32 is intended to replace lcg64_32
				it is not as fast, but comparable on 32 bit CPUs
				and has significantly better quality and statespace
				in particular, 
		changes to specific RNGs:
			sha2_based_pool
				fixed a bug that could produce crashes
				now in the PractRand::RNGs::Polymorphic namespace instead of PractRand::RNGs::Polymorphic::EntropyPools
			arbee
				changed input mixing algorithm; flush_buffers() now meaningful
				namespace changed (see RNG category changes)
				namespace changed: PractRand::RNGs::Polymorphic::EntropyPools -> PractRand::RNGs::Polymorphic
				namespace changed: PractRand::RNGs::Raw::EntropyPools -> PractRand::RNGs::Raw
			sfc32, sfc64
				tweaked integer seeding to reduce chances of any 2 seeds being nearby in a cycle
			isaac_with_sha2_pool
				removed - if you want something comparable, use sha2_based_pool to seed a faster RNG
			efiix8x256, efiix16x256, efiix32x256, efiix64x256
				renamed to efiix8x384, efiix16x384, efiix32x384, efiix64x384
				tweaked algorithm to improve security
			isaac32x256, isaac64x256
				tweaked implementation to improve speed on some compilers
				changed seeding - now closer to reference algorithm & higher quality
				validation code was added to make sure that this is working correctly
			hc256
				tweaked implementation to improve speed on some compilers
				validation code was added to make sure that this is working correctly
			mwlac64, mwlac32, mwlac16
				removed, for real this time (was supposed to be removed in the prior version)
			mt19937
				validation code was added to make sure that this is working correctly
			lcg64_32
				removed - use xsm32 instead
			clcg96_32
				removed - use xsm64 instead

			program 3:
				use statistical tests on an RNGs output
		changed how speed test results are displayed
	new example program:
		multithreaded RNG testing, currently WIN32 only

		added new recommended RNG:
			sfc16 / sfc32 / sfc64:
				relatively low quality, but very fast and small
				uses only addition, xor, shift, and barrel-shift
				state size is only 3 words
		removed existing recommended RNG:
			mwlac32 / mwlac64:
				Redundant when compared to jsf32/jsf64 to justify inclusion.
